## Reading In Data

```

## Visualization

```{r}
sample.size <- nrow(total_new.data)

total_new.data$putt.col <- total_new.data$Putts + 1
total_new.data$putt.col


# plot data and f(x)
plot(interpolated_data$midpoint, interpolated_data$fairway )
plot(interpolated_data$midpoint, interpolated_data$rough )
ggplot(data = interpolated_data, aes(x = yards)) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    
    # Features of the first axis
    name = "Fairway Strokes Gained",
    
    # Add a second axis and specify its features
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~., name="Rough Strokes Gained")
    
  ) + geom_line( aes(y=fairway), color= "darkgreen")+ geom_line( aes(y=rough), color = "red") + theme(
    axis.title.y = element_text(color = "darkgreen", size=13),
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(color = "red", size=13)
  ) + ggtitle("Temperature down, price up")

From the interpolation of the fairway and the rough strokes gained. We see that there is a clear difference such that each shot in the rough clearer has a higher expected strokes value. 


For the Basic stroked gained model of what we can model so far, is modeling the number of putts that we could expect land on the green depending on the 

## Modeling

```{r}
total_new.data$putt.col
```

```{r}
#strokes remanining until the approach list 
model <- lm(total_new.data$putt.col ~ total_new.data$Approach.Dist, data = total_new.data)
summary(model)

(prelim.plot.strokes.gained <- ggplot(total_new.data, aes(x = Approach.Dist, y = strokesgained)) +
        geom_jitter() +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm"))


```



From each approach distance, this model was built off of 1044 sample sizes for different approach games. 

We believe that we could have a better model if we were to use 



If we use a non parametric model, this is the time of smoothing we get

```{r}

new.model <- loess(fairway ~ yards, data = interpolated_data, span = 0.25)
summary(new.model)
plot(new.model,main = "Rough Expected Strokes Green", xlab = "Approach Distance to Green (yards)", ylab = "Expected Stroked Remaining")


new.model <- loess(rough ~ yards, data = interpolated_data, span = 0.25)
summary(new.model)
plot(new.model,main = "Rough Expected Strokes Gained", xlab = "Approach Distance to Green (yards)", ylab = "Expected Stroked Remaining")
```



Then we have a basic model here that is bale to show the expected strokes based on yards as what we could
