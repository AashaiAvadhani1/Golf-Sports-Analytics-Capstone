## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)  # load the package
library("ggplot2")                     # Load ggplot2 package
library("GGally") 
library(tidyverse)
library(ISLR)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(mgcv)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Reading In Data

```{r}

## The Script where the strokes gained model is giong to be built
interploated_data <- read.csv("strokesGainedInterpolated.csv")
golf_data <-  read.csv("GolfData.csv")
total_new.data <- read.csv("total_new.csv")

```


## Modeling

```{r}
#strokes remanining until the approach list 
new.model <- smooth.spline((putt) ~  Approach.Dist, data = total_new.data)
plot(new.model)

(prelim.plot.strokes.gained <- ggplot(total_new.data, aes(x = Approach.Dist, y = strokesgained)) +
        geom_jitter() +
        geom_smooth(method = "lm"))


```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
